## Nairaland scraper(still under development, mostly refining the code)

Nairaland is a Nigerian English-language internet forum. Founded by Nigerian entrepreneur Seun Osewa on March 8, 2005, it is targeted primarily at Nigerian domestic residents and is the 6th most visited website in Nigeria.

The webscraper built here receives a search term one would want to find out about on the nairaland platform search for post on these search terms, extract the pages of results, extract all post on these pages as well as the details of the post like the board it was posted on and more

A more detailed Readme file would be added in the future
